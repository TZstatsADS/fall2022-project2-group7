# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

## Project Title NYC Motor Vehicle Accidents
Term: Fall 2022

+ Team 7
+ **Projec title**: NYC Motor Vehicle Accidents
	+ Chaitanya Shah
	+ Weilin Zhou
	+ John Podias

+ **Project summary**: This project provides the ability to explore traffic patterns through the years and see how COVID has affected it. It can be used by a number of different audiences. Primarily, it can used by the NYPD & Vision Zero (the citywide safety traffic initiative) for the purposes of improving safety. It can even be used by NYC commuters to plan optimal routes, or prospective home buyers to explore safer neighborhoods. Users can analyze the initial extreme COVID effects in 2020, but also see what persists today since the data is updated daily. We know COVID has changed travel due to things like remote work and limited flights, but there are different ways to explore it

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 

+ Weilin Zhou handled the data processing, cleaning and exploratory analysis, making a frame for further analysis. 
+ Chaitanya Shah mainly develop the Shiny app, creating the layout, working on more informative pages, producing several charts 
+ John Podias mainly worked on the 'Map'page part and incorporated the death of covid-cases.
